        Information on how each different demographic factor affects social anxiety:
        show gender, age, occupation breakdowns

        Maybe, "build your own adventure" style, where as the user goes down the page,
        they select what gender they want to see stats for, then age and this is
        affected by the previous choice, and then occupation. The user can move up
        the page and change their selections at any point, to createa  different "story".
      </p> -->

      <p>
        Though social anxiety can absolutely affect people of many different backgrounds
        and situations, it is important to notice that a person's individual demographics
        can affect their life experience. In turn, this can make them more susceptible
        or likely to experience high levels of anxiety. The dataset we used has a number of
        demographic identifiers labeled along the data such as age, gender, and occupation.
      </p>

      <h3>Age</h3>
      <p>
        The age of participants in any survey is always a crucial factor to consider.
        When looking at and analyzing data, or even setting up a survey, you have to judge
        what kind of sample will be represented in your survey (one specific age group or
        a broad number of them). But even more important, in this dataset, it would be
        important to understant how different ages can be affected by social anxiety.
        The participants in the dataset ranged from 18 to 64 years of age. The mean age
        is 40.2, and while there are several peaks at certain age ranges (18, 26, 32, 42, 48, 56, 63)
        of around 700 participants, there are fair amounts of answers in the other in between ages of around 520 participants.
      </p>
      <h4> Avg. Anxiety by Age</h4>
      <div> <!--- age w means-->
        <canvas class="graphs" id="age_means"></canvas>
      </div>
      <p>As we can see, there isn't an overtly strong and constant correlation
      with age and anxiety, as many of the individual ages have oscillations in the graph
      betweeen higher and lower values. However, it is interesting to note a strong
      pattern in this, that being that the young ages of 18-19 and the old ages of
      50 to 64 registered far lower levels of anxiety than the somewhat stable peaks of the in between range. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Gender</h3>
    <p> Another possibly important aspect of an individual's demographics is their
      gender, as it can affect that person's experiences and thus the anxiety they
      may expereience on a daily basis.
      In our dataset, participants responded with whether they identified their gender
      as "Male", "Female", or "Other". In terms of representativeness, this dataset has a
      very even distribution amongst these three options, with 33% of participants identifying
      as "Male" and 33% as "Other", while the remaning 34% identified as "Female".
    </p>
    <h4> Avg. Anxiety by Gender</h4>
    <div> <!--- gender w means-->
      <canvas class="graphs" id="gender_means"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>As we can see, the consistency of participants continues, with near identical average
      anxiety level per gener response, Female: 3.93  Male: 3.93  Other: 3.92. This strong
      pattern tells us that there isn't a strong correlation
    between gender identity and anxiety, as regardless of individual gender
    registered average levels of anxiety were the same. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Occupation</h3>
    <p> One of the most prominent parts of most people's daily lives is what they do
      for a job. Out of many jobs that are available, the type of job it is, how demanding
      it can be, and what it entails be done, will all influence how a person feels
      about it, and since it will take up large amounts of hours daily, a person's
      occupation can strongly affect their anxiety in life.
      In our dataset, participants would enter their occupation as one of the following:
      "Artist", "Athlete", "Chef", "Doctor", "Engineer",
      "Freelancer", "Lawyer", "Musician", "Nurse", "Scientist", "Student", "Teacher", and "Other".
      The most common of these was "Musician" and "Artist", with 8% of participants. However,
      there are a decent amount of other ocupations represented
    </p>
    <h4> Avg. Anxiety by Occupation</h4>
    <div> <!--- occupation w means-->
      <canvas class="graphs" id="occupation_means"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>As we can see, there is some, but not overwhelming, correlation
    with how high/low a participant's anxiety and their job, since average anxiety responses
    ranged within only 0.5 of each other. However, there are still some interesting observtaions
  to be made based on this, such as Teacher being the lowest anxiety, which may or may not seem
  logical, while Lawyer was the highest anxiety.  </p>
