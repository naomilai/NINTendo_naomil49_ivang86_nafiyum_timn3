      <!-- <p>
        Information on how each different demographic factor affects social anxiety:
        show gender, age, occupation breakdowns

        Maybe, "build your own adventure" style, where as the user goes down the page,
        they select what gender they want to see stats for, then age and this is
        affected by the previous choice, and then occupation. The user can move up
        the page and change their selections at any point, to createa  different "story".
      </p> -->

      <p>
        Though social anxiety can absolutely affect people of many different backgrounds
        and situations, it is important to notice that a person's individual demographics
        can affect their life experience. In turn, this can make them more susceptible
        or likely to experience high levels of anxiety. The dataset we used has a number of
        demographic identifiers labeled along the data such as age, gender, and occupation.
      </p>

      <h3>Age</h3>
      <p>
        The age of participants in any survey is always a crucial factor to consider.
        When looking at and analyzing data, or even setting up a survey, you have to judge
        what kind of sample will be represented in your survey (one specific age group or
        a broad number of them). But even more important, in this dataset, it would be
        important to understant how different ages can be affected by social anxiety.
        The participants in the dataset ranged from 18 to 64 years of age. The mean age
        is 40.2, and while there are several peaks at certain age ranges (18, 26, 32, 42, 48, 56, 63)
        of around 700 participants, there are fair amounts of answers in the other in between ages of around 520 participants.

        <b><h1>GRAPH GOES HERE</h1></b>
      <p>Graph analysis here. As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
      with age and anxiety, as few/many of the individuals that are older/younger
      , registered higher/lower levels of anxiety. </p>

    <h3>Gender</h3>
    <p> Another important aspect of an individual's quality of mental health is
      how thoroughly it is maintained. Therapy is one of the leading and most
      beneficial ways to ensure overall quality of life, by dealing with mental
      health challenges and strong emotions.
      In our dataset, participant data is held on whether there is any history
      of anxiety within their family by "True" and "False". Overall, across the data
      roughly 53%, or 5847 individuals, answered true to having a family history of
      anxiety. </p>
      <b><h1>GRAPH GOES HERE</h1></b>
    <p>Graph analysis here. As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
    with a family history of anxiety, as few/many of the individuals with family
    history of anxiety registered high levels of anxiety. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Occupation</h3>
    <p> Though anxiety is a disorder that stands separate from others, both in
      possible causes but also in steps taken to help treat it, other factors,
      specifically similar mental health issues, can very often be corresponding
      and relating to the prevalence of anxiety.
      In our dataset, participant data on their stress level is obtained with a
      participant self-judged rating of how stressed they are in their life
      on a scale of 1 to 10. In general, there was a fairly even distribution of
      responses from 1 to 7, of around 1000 participants per each of those ratings,
      with another set of consistency from 8 to 10, with around 1350 particpants
      identifying themselves among each of those ratings. Though somewhat leaning
      towards the higher values, the mean ends up at 5.86, which still makes it a
    fairly even and representative set of data. </p>
