      <!-- <p>
        Information on how each different mental health factor affects social anxiety:
        show sleep hours, physical activity, diet quality, alcohol use, caffeine intake, smoking habits, recent major life events
        (maybe this is where we also put other health stuff? EX: heart rate, breathing rate, sweating level, dizziness)

        Maybe, "build your own adventure" style, where as the user goes down the page,
        they select a certain answer for their "character" and sees how it affects their
        likelihood of anxiety (see demographics for a little more detail on this idea).
      </p> -->

      <p>
        Although social anxiety is mainly associated with mental health, the quality
        of someone's physical life can very greatly affect their mental wellbeing.
        "Poor physical health can lead to higher stress levels, low energy and an
        increased risk of mental health problems, creating a cycle that's tough to
        break. This is why it's so important to take care of your body as part of
        looking after your mind, ensuring that you feel better all around"(https://changemh.org/resources/physical-health-and-mental-health/).
        In this dataset, a very large number of physical health related factors have been
        collected from the many particpants, with the main ones we will look at being
        hours slept, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.
      </p>

      <h3>Hours of Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        We are sure that everyone has at one point or another heard of how vital sleep
        is to a generally healthy lifestyle, which is unquestionably true.
        In this dataset, participants reported their hours slept per night, with responses
        ranging from only 2.3 hours up to 11.3 hours. The biggest peak of reported
        hours slept is at around 7 hours from around 1,830 particpants. The mean hours
        slept is 6.65.
      </p>
        <b><h1>GRAPH GOES HERE</h1></b>
      <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
      with hours slept per night and anxiety, as few/many of the individuals that sleep more/less
      , reporetd higher/lower levels of anxiety. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
    <p>
      Time and time again, a person's physical activity has been shown to correlate
      with a generally higher quality of life, whether it be student athletes that get
      higher grades, or active people who live longer and happier lives.
      As such, in our dataset, participants reported their levels of physical activity
      with the amount of hours they are physically active in a week. The responses range
      from 0 to 10.1 hours, and heavily skews right, with 0-4 hours having around 8,000
      total respondees, with a dramatic decline after that. This makes the mean of the
      hours excersied weekly only 2.94.
    </p>
      <b><h1>GRAPH GOES HERE</h1></b>
    <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, that high/low physical activity is/isn't
    strongly/weakly correlated with anxiety, as few/many of the individuals that
    excersied regularly/not regularly, reported high/low levels of anxiety. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Alcohol Consumption</h3>
    <p>
      Alcohol is a very potentially dangerous influence on any person's mental and
      physical health, since it can be very harmful in excess. Still, it is a
      socially acceptable drug, that is consumed by many ages. Thus, it is an important
      factor to consider in a person's potential health.
      In our dataset, participants logged the amount of drinks that they had every week,
      to help judge how much of an impact this may have. This ranged from 0 to 19 drinks
      and had decently even distribution of around 550 responses for each number in the
      range, making the mean a 9.7, close to the middle of that range.
    </p>
    <b><h1>GRAPH GOES HERE</h1></b>
    <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
    with how much/little alcohol a participant consumes weekly, as few/many of the individuals
    who consumed high/low numbers of drinks reported overall higher/lower levels of anxiety.
