      <!-- <p>
        Information on how each different mental health factor affects social anxiety:
        show sleep hours, physical activity, diet quality, alcohol use, caffeine intake, smoking habits, recent major life events
        (maybe this is where we also put other health stuff? EX: heart rate, breathing rate, sweating level, dizziness)

        Maybe, "build your own adventure" style, where as the user goes down the page,
        they select a certain answer for their "character" and sees how it affects their
        likelihood of anxiety (see demographics for a little more detail on this idea).
      </p> -->

      <p>
        Though social anxiety can absolutely affect people of many different backgrounds
        and situations, it is important to notice that a person's individual demographics
        can affect their life experience. In turn, this can make them more susceptible
        or likely to experience high levels of anxiety. The dataset we used has a number of
        demographic identifiers labeled along the data such as age, gender, and occupation.
      </p>

      <h3>Hours of Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        The age of participants in any survey is always a crucial factor to consider.
        When looking at and analyzing data, or even setting up a survey, you have to judge
        what kind of sample will be represented in your survey (one specific age group or
        a broad number of them). But even more important, in this dataset, it would be
        important to understant how different ages can be affected by social anxiety.
        The participants in the dataset ranged from 18 to 64 years of age. The mean age
        is 40.2, and while there are several peaks at certain age ranges (18, 26, 32, 42, 48, 56, 63)
        of around 700 participants, there are fair amounts of answers in the other in between ages of around 520 participants.
      </p>
        <b><h1>GRAPH GOES HERE</h1></b>
      <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
      with age and anxiety, as few/many of the individuals that are older/younger
      , registered higher/lower levels of anxiety. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
    <p> Another possibly important aspect of an individual's demographics is their
      gender, as it can affect that person's experiences and thus the anxiety they
      may expereience on a daily basis.
      In our dataset, participants responded with whether they identified their gender
      as "Male", "Female", or "Other". In terms of representativeness, this dataset has a
      very even distribution amongst these three options, with 33% of participants identifying
      as "Male" and 33% as "Other", while the remaning 34% identified as "Female".
    </p>

    <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
    between gender and anxiety, as few/many of the individuals that identified
    as Male/Female/Other registered high/low levels of anxiety. </p>

    <h3>Alcohol Consumption</h3>
    <p> One of the most prominent parts of most people's daily lives is what they do
      for a job. Out of many jobs that are available, the type of job it is, how demanding
      it can be, and what it entails be done, will all influence how a person feels
      about it, and since it will take up large amounts of hours daily, a person's
      occupation can strongly affect their anxiety in life.
      In our dataset, participants would enter their occupation as one of the following:
      "Artist", "Athlete", "Chef", "Doctor", "Engineer",
      "Freelancer", "Lawyer", "Musician", "Nurse", "Scientist", "Student", "Teacher", and "Other".
      The most common of these was "Musician" and "Artist", with 8% of participants. However,
      there are a decent amount of other ocupations represented
    </p>

    <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
    with how high/low a participant's occupation is, as few/many of the individuals
    with XYZ job(s) reported higher/lower levels of anxiety, as compared to
    thos who work as ABC jobs. </p>
