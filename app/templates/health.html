      <!-- <p>
        Information on how each different mental health factor affects social anxiety:
        show person mental health history, family history, therapy frequency, use of medication, stres level
        (maybe this is where we also put other health stuff? EX: heart rate, breathing rate, sweating level, dizziness)

        Maybe, "build your own adventure" style, where as the user goes down the page,
        they select a certain answer for their "character" and sees how it affects their
        likelihood of anxiety (see demographics for a little more detail on this idea).
      </p> -->

      <p>
        Social anxiety is obviously a very complex issue which can stem from any number of many factors. First and foremost,
        social anxiety is a mental health condition which undoubtedly affects the thought process in the daily lives of
        those affected by it. In our dataset, a number of mental health related factors were added into consideration when
        gathering data from the participants, such as family history of anxiety, therapy frequency, stress level, and more.
      </p>

      <h3>Family history of anxiety</h3>
      <p>Undoubtedly, genetics and family history of mental health can be one of
        the most prominent factors in a person's risks to developing similar
        conditions. UNC Health psychiatric epidemiologist Anna Bauer, PhD, MPH. states
        that "Children of parents who have a diagnosed anxiety disorder can be as much
        as seven times more likely to develop an anxious disorder themselves"(https://healthtalk.unchealthcare.org/does-anxiety-run-in-families/).
        In our dataset, participant data is held on whether there is any history
        of anxiety within their family by "True" and "False". Overall, across the data
        roughly 53%, or 5847 individuals, answered true to having a family history of
        anxiety.

      <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
      with therapy frequency, as few/many of the individuals that attended therapy
      (less) frequently, registered higher/lower levels of anxiety. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Therapy Frequency</h3>
    <p> Another important aspect of an individual's quality of mental health is
      how thoroughly it is maintained. Therapy is one of the leading and most
      beneficial ways to ensure overall quality of life, by dealing with mental
      health challenges and strong emotions.
      In our dataset, participant data is held on how many therapy sessions the
      participant attends per month, with responses ranging from 0 to 12. The mean number
      of sessions per month was around 2.43, with a heavy right skew in distribution
      meaning most responses were on the lower end (0 to 2).
    </p>

    <p><b>Graph analysis here.</b> As we can see, there is/isn't a strong/weak correlation
    with a family history of anxiety, as few/many of the individuals with family
    history of anxiety registered high levels of anxiety. </p>

<br>

    <h3>Stress Level</h3>
    <p> Though anxiety is a disorder that stands separate from others, both in
      possible causes but also in steps taken to help treat it, other factors,
      specifically similar mental health issues, can very often be corresponding
      and relating to the prevalence of anxiety.
      In our dataset, participant data on their stress level is obtained with a
      participant self-judged rating of how stressed they are in their life
      on a scale of 1 to 10. In general, there was a fairly even distribution of
      responses from 1 to 7, of around 1000 participants per each of those ratings,
      with another set of consistency from 8 to 10, with around 1350 particpants
      identifying themselves among each of those ratings. Though somewhat leaning
      towards the higher values, the mean ends up at 5.86, which still makes it a
    fairly even and representative set of data. </p>
